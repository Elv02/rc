# Multiplayer Treasure Hunting Game (Title WIP) Feature Checklist

## Overview

Tracks the features which have been delivered on as promised in the [Proposal](Proposal.md). 
The goal of this document is to provide a detailed aid/guide for testing/grading.

### Deployment Instructions for Test

By default the backend server will deploy in 127.0.0.1 and port 8123 for the Websocket. It is recommended not to change this.
If it is required to change (i.e. the port is in use) you will need to update the webpack config file in the client folder.
Perform a find-and-replace on the default URL `ws://127.0.0.1:8123`, ensuring that you don't change the protocol (ws).

The asset backend is served on port 8081 and is non-configurable due to time constraints and technical challenges.
